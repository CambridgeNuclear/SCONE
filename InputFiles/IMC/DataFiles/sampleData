// Sample material data file for IMC calculations
// Very simple, only exists to keep material creation more consistent with other calculation types

  // Set of equations to use for opacities and heat capacities, currently have densmore, marshak and
  // holraum. Adding new cases requires recompiling but this allows for complex multi-frequency eqns.

/\/\ Optional Inputs /\/\

  // Multiple either opacity or heat capacity by a constant. Useful if wanting to change constant
  // value in complex equations without having to recompile (e.g. different densmore MF cases)
  // Default to 1

  // Constant in Fleck factor, defaults to 1
