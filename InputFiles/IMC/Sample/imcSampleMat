  // Set polynomial temperature-dependent opacities for the material.
  // Currently have only considered the grey case, if using a frequency dependent opacity
  //   then this would need to be changed to a more complex input.
  // Input should be a 1D array of coefficients followed by exponents, with any polynomial
  //   length allowed
  // e.g. Here, sigmaA = 1 + 2T

sigmaA (    // Absorption opacity
 1  2       // Coefficients
 0  1       // Exponents
);

sigmaS (    // Scattering opacity
 0
 0
);

  // Set temperature-dependent specific heat capacity of the material.
  // Same format as above.
  // Currently cannot have an exponent of exactly -1, as cv is integrated simply by adding 1 to
  //   exponents an have not yet allowed T^(-1) to integrate to ln(T).
  // After integration, solved by Newton-Raphson solver. Some choices of cv may not converge, 
  //   and some will give negative energies and temperatures. Unsure if this is due to some
  //   numerical oversight in the way the calculation is done or if these are just unphysical
  //   choices.
  // e.g. Here, cv = 4T^3 - 2T + T^(-0.5)
cv (
 4  -2   1      // Coefficients
 3   1  -0.5      // Exponents
);
