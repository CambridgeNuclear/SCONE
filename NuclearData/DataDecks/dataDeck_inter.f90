  !!
  !! Abstract Nuclear Data Library Access interface
  !!
  !! Name is chosen for reto-associations
  !!
  !! This abstract type creates a family of objects that can be used to build
  !! Nuclear Data objects for execution (e.g. reactions, nuclides, materials etc.)
  !! This allow to create an easy interface for building nuclear data object from
  !! multiple library formats (ACE, HDF5, SCONE Dictionary etc.)
  !!
  !! It is up to every nuclearData object to decide how it can be built!
  !!
  !! Interface:
  !!   myType -> Return character with type name. Usefull for error messages!
