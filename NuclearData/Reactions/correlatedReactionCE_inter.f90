  !! Outgoing particle sample data
  !!
  !! Helper type to group data for a single outgoing particle sample
  !!
  !! Public members:
  !!   mu    -> cosine of polar deflection angle in [0;1]
  !!   phi   -> azimuthal deflection angle in [0;2*pi]
  !!   E_out -> outgoing energy of the particle [MeV]

  !! Multiple samples of outgoing particles
  !!
  !! Helper type to return an unknown number of correlated particles samples
  !! Uses global parameter MAX_OUTGOING_PARTICLES to know at compile-time how
  !! much space to reserve for particles data. It needs to avoid memory allocation
  !! on run-time for efficiency
  !!
  !! Public members:
  !!   N       -> number of samples generated N is integer in [0, MAX_OUTGOING_PARTICLES]
  !!   samples -> array of outSample type. Each enetry has data for a single outgoing sample

  !! Reaction that produces secendary reaction that are correleated with each other
  !!
  !! This means that thare is a significant correlation between emitted particles.
  !! As the result all of outgoing particles need to be sampled at once

  !!   inCMframe -> returns true if reaction is in Centre-Of-Mass frame
  !!   sampleOut -> returns "outgoingSamples" with samples of outgoing particles
