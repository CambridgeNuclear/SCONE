First Steps - Compiling new files and tests
===========================================

In this tutorial you will learn:

* How to create new branch in Git
* How to add new source file to compile with SCONE
* How to create and compile a simple unit test for your code
* How to add new files to Git and commit changes

This tutorial assumes that you use a UNIX-like environment.
Some knowledge of basic UNIX command line commands is essential.

Creating new Git Branch
-----------------------
#. We assume that you have already cloned SCONE on to your machine. Information
   on how to do that is available in (:ref:`installation`)

#. Let us first navigate to a main source code directory. This is the one that
   contains all folders like *Apps*, *DataStructures*, *SharedModules* etc.
   Type ``ls`` command to verify that you are in correct Folder.

#. We will proceed to make some changes. However, we also want to preserve
   an image of the code in its current, clean form. This is where version
   control with git comes into play. Into your console type ``git branch``
   and you should see something like this ::

     dancoffBellTally
     errors-module
     makeDictGreatAgain
     * develop
     missingENDFLaws
     newNuclearData

#. With this command we have asked git to list all local branches (that is
   independent images of the code repository, changes in one branch do not
   influence a code in another unless we specifically combine some of them
   with ``git merge``). The ``*`` indicates that we are currently in a
   ``develop`` branch. We want to create a new branch for our tutorial.
   We can do it by creating a new branch with ``git branch tutorials``,
   where ``tutorials`` could be replaced with any name for new branch. We
   also need to switch to the new branch we just created. Do it with
   ``git checkout tutorials``. Now when you type ``git branch`` you should
   see something like this ::

     dancoffBellTally
     errors-module
     makeDictGreatAgain
     master
     * tutorials
     missingENDFLaws
     newNuclearData

Creating new Fortran module
---------------------------

#. Now that we have created space where we can easily separate our modifications
   from the original code, let us do some changes. First we will create a new
   directory for the files related to the tutorial. Type ``mkdir TutorialFiles``
   to create new folder.

#. Now we shall create a new source file. First navigate to the new Folder by
   ``cd TutorialFiles`` and create new file with ``echo '' >> tutorial1_func.f90``.
   One the file is created open it with your text editor of choise and fill it
   with content ::

     module tutorial1_func

       use numPrecision

       implicit none
       private

       public :: hello
       public :: quest

     contains

       !!
       !! Prints nonsense text to the console
       !!
       !! Args:
       !!   None
       !!
       !! Errors:
       !!   None
       !!
       subroutine hello()

         print *, "I wish for some good Devonshire cream tea..."

       end subroutine hello

       !!
       !! Return an integer
       !!
       !! Args:
       !!   None
       !!
       !! Result:
       !!   Answer to the Ultimate Question.
       !!
       !! Errors:
       !!   None
       !!
       elemental function quest() result(i)
         integer(shortInt)     :: i

         i = 42

       end function quest

     end module tutorial1_func

#. OK. So now we have a new Fortran module. Note that we are already following
   the :ref:`style-guide`. In tutorial it is not necessary, but from personal
   experience I recommend to try to get into the habit of writing documentation
   and descriptive comments from the get-go. What we want to do now is to
   compile the new module. To do that we need to register it with Cmake so it
   is included in a long list of source files that get compiled into libscone.a
   library. In the TutorialFiles folder create new file ``CMakeLists.txt``.
   Note that the capitalisation and extension is important! Inside the file write ::

     # Add source files to a global list
     add_sources(./tutorial1_func.f90)

#. What we have done is we have created a file for CMake with instructions on
   what do to in this folder. However, we haven't told CMake that
   ``TutorialFiles`` folder exists at all! To do this we need to step
   to the folder below (``cd ..``), which is our case is the main source
   directory. Within it we can easily find ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.
   In it we need to add a line ``add_subdirectory(TutorialFiles)``.
   You can easily find the section where the other folders are registered ::

      ###############################################################################
      # COLLECT ALL SOURCE AND TEST FILES

      # Include Nested Directories
      add_subdirectory(RandomNumbers)
      add_subdirectory(LinearAlgebra)
      add_subdirectory(SharedModules)
      add_subdirectory(VTK)
      add_subdirectory(ParticleObjects)
      add_subdirectory(NamedGrids)

      add_subdirectory(NuclearData)
      add_subdirectory(GeometryObjects)
      add_subdirectory(Tallies)

      add_subdirectory(CollisionOperator)
      add_subdirectory(TransportOperator)

      add_subdirectory(UserInterface)

      add_subdirectory(PhysicsPackages)
      add_subdirectory(DataStructures)

      # Tutorial Folders
      add_subdirectory(TutorialFiles)
      ###############################################################################

#. Now your module should be compiled. Test that this is a case by introducing
   a deliberate error in ``tutorial1_func.f90``.


Creating a simple Unit Test
---------------------------

#. Now that we have written some code we need to make sure that it does what
   we want. In practice no matter how simple the function is and how unlikely
   it is that we have make a mistake, some sneaky bug will find its way in.
   It is best to catch it quickly! Then we will spend much less time
   debugging some mysterious crashes. If you are not convinced by the need
   for automated testing yet please have a look at extra arguments in
   :ref:`unit-testing`.

#. First thing we need to do is to create folder to store our test files.
   In ``TutorialFiles`` create ``Tests`` subfolder. Inside it create a
   ``tutorial1_test.f90`` file. And fill it as follows ::

     module tutorial1_test

       use tutorial1_func, only : quest
       use pFUnit_mod

       implicit none

     contains

       !!
       !! Test the Ultimate Question
       !!
     @Test
       subroutine testUltimateQuestion()

         !! Test Question
         @assertEqual( 43, quest() )


       end subroutine testUltimateQuestion


     end module tutorial1_test

#. You may notice that the answer to **the question** is 42 not 43, so the
   test will fail for the correct result. This is deliberate. We want the
   test to fail so we can make sure that the test is indeed compiling and
   executing. Then we can change the values back to what we expect and ensure
   that the code is indeed correct. In order to finish we must register the
   test with out CMake script. We need to go back to the ``CMakeLists.txt``
   in the ``TutorialFiles`` folder and add a line ::

     # Add source files to a global list
     add_sources(./tutorial1_func.f90)

     # Register unit tests
     add_unit_tests(./Tests/tutorial1_test.f90)

#. Now recompile the code making sure that you are compiling it together with tests!
   Upon successful compilation execute ``unitTests`` binary in the build folder.
   It should give you a message like this ::

     ................................................................................
     ...........................................................F
     Time:         0.079 seconds

     Failure
      in:
     tutorial1_test_suite.testUltimateQuestion
      Location:
     [tutorial1_test.f90:11]
     expected 43 but found: 42;  difference: |1|.

      FAILURES!!!
     Tests run: 139, Failures: 1, Errors: 0


#. Clearly our new test was run and failed! Now go back to ``tutorial1_test.f90``
   and change 43 to 42. Recompile and execute the test binary again. Now it
   should read ::

     ................................................................................
     ...........................................................
     Time:         0.101 seconds

     OK
     (139 tests)

#. Which means that the test was successful and our trivial procedure does what
   we have expected. Note that we have not tested ``hello`` subroutine.
   It is because it is impossible to test the console messages within the
   pFUnit test framework. The same, unfortunately, goes for any
   warnings or fatal errors that can be produced. See :ref:`unit-testing`.

Creating an executable
----------------------

#. Often we want to be able to execute some simple code to test that its
   behaviour is as we believe it to be, or we want to play a bit with some
   of the SCONE components to get used to them. Using the pFUnit test framework
   for it would be inconvenient. It is much simpler to create a simple program.
   In order to do so we need to create a new file in Apps folder e.g.
   ``sandbox.f90``. ::

     program sandbox

       use numPrecision
       use tutorial1_func, only : hello
       implicit none

       call hello()

     end program sandbox

#. It is a bit more difficult to register it with CMake and make sure it is
   compiled. Once again go to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` in main source directory
   and add an extra entry to *COMPILE SOLVERS* section ::

     ###############################################################################
     # COMPILE SOLVERS
     add_executable(scone.out ./Apps/scone.f90 )
     target_link_libraries(scone.out scone )

     # TUTORIAL EXECUTABLE
     add_executable(sandbox.out ./Apps/sandbox.f90)
     target_link_libraries(sandbox.out scone)

     ###############################################################################

#. Now recompile and a new executable ``sandbox.out`` should be produced in
   build folder. Run it and see that it indeed produces the expected result.

Committing changes
-----------------
#. In the last step we would like to add the changes we have made to the git
   repository. We have created a number of new files so we need to make Git
   track their changes. First of all let us see what new files Git sees.
   Write ``git status`` and you should see something like this ::

     # On branch tutorials
     # Changes not staged for commit:
     #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
     #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
     #
     #       modified:   CMakeLists.txt
     #
     # Untracked files:
     #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
     #
     #       Apps/sandbox.f90
     #       Debug/
     #       TutorialFiles/
     no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

#. So clearly Git sees that we have created new files. And modified some it is
   already tracking. You might have already heard of the term *commit*.
   Basically each commit is a snapshot of a state of repository. Each branch
   is then a chain of commits (snapshots) from the latest one to the
   first one. Thus to save our changes we need to create a new commit.
   We begin by *staging* all the changes we have made. You can do it
   file-by-file using ``git add <file>`` as the git status message suggests.
   Note that we cannot use ``git add --all`` because we have to ensure that
   build folder that contains all compilation files in not tracked to keep
   repository clean.  Now when we use ``git status`` again we shall see
   something like this::

     # On branch tutorials
     # Changes to be committed:
     #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
     #
     #       new file:   Apps/sandbox.f90
     #       modified:   CMakeLists.txt
     #       new file:   TutorialFiles/myFile
     #

#. Now what is left do do is commit the changes. We use ``git commit`` for that.
   If we type it just like it is it will open a text editor in the console.
   Usually it will be vim. We need to prepare commit message. Use *Insert* or *i*
   key to  enter edit mode in vim. In the first line provide a basic explanation
   for the changes e.g. *Create Tutorial Infrastructure*. Make sure it is
   shorter then 50 columns. If you want to provide same extra information,
   leave 2nd line blank and write some extra text starting from the 3rd line.
   After you are finished use *Esc* key to exit from vim edit mode and type
   ``:wq`` to write your changes and quit. After that you will see something
   like that ::

     [tutorials 5b8b5bd] Created some random files
     3 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
     create mode 100644 Apps/sandbox.f90
     create mode 100644 TutorialFiles/myFile

#. You have created the commit. Note that if you want to provide only the
   basic message with your commit you can do it without using vim with
   ``git commit -m '<Your message of less the 50 characters>'``.

#. This concludes the tutorial.
