What is SCONE?
==============

SCONE stands for **S**\ tochastic **C**\ alculator **O**\ f **N**\ eutron
Transport **E**\ quation. It is a Monte Carlo particle transport code for prototyping
of new methods. Unlike its more established cousins it does not strive for the fastest
execution speed, since it is not intended to be used for practical design calculation. Instead it
aims to offer flexibility to allow relatively inexperienced users, such as graduate students
to quickly test their ideas.
