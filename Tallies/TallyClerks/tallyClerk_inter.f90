  !!
  !! Abstract interface for a single tallyClerk.
  !! It recives reports from tallyAdmin and process them into scores on scoreMemory
  !!
  !! Its responsibilites are as follows:
  !! 1) Score some result on scoreMemory by accepting a subset of all avalible reports
  !! 2) Display implementation determined measure of convergence (usually some variance)
  !! 3) Can return information about reports it requires
  !! 4) Can return a tallyResult object for interaction with Physics Package
  !!
  !! Every tally Clerk is allocated memory location on score memory
  !! Every tally Clerk has a name
  !!
  !! An implementation of a Clerk needs to override procedures related to reports to
  !! be able to process events reprts. Default behaviour for every report is to throw fatalError.
  !!
  !! Private Members:
  !!   memAddress -> Location of the Clerk Memory on ScoreMemory (64-bit integer)
  !!   name -> String with Clerk Name
  !!
  !! Interface:
  !!   init             -> Initialise Clerk from a dictionary
  !!   kill             -> Return to Uninitialised State
  !!   validReports     -> Returns array of integers with tallyCodes of reports that the clark requires
  !!   getSize          -> Return size required by Clerk on ScoreMemory
  !!   setMemAddress    -> Setter for "memAddress" member
  !!   getMemAddress    -> Getter for "memAddress" member
  !!   setName          -> Setter for "name" member
  !!   getName          -> Getter for "name" member
  !!   reportInColl     -> Process an incident into collision report
  !!   reportOutColl    -> Process an outgoing from collision report
  !!   reportPath       -> Process pathlength report
  !!   reportTrans      -> Process transition report
  !!   reportHist       -> Process history report
  !!   reportCycleStart -> Process beginning of a cycle report
  !!   reportCycleEnd   -> Process end of a cycle report (e.g. Calculate functions of scores like k-eff)
  !!   isConverged      -> Return .true. if convergence criterion has been reached
  !!   display          -> Display to the console current value of a Score
  !!   print            -> Print results to the output file
