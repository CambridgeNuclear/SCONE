!! Factory of tallyMap1D
!!
!! Build an instance of a tallyMap1D from a dictionary. Can build it as class(tallyMap1D) or
!! as class(tallyMap)
!!
!! Public Members:
!!   AVALIBLE_tallyMaps1D -> PARAMETER nameLen array of names of avalible talyMaps1D
!!
!! Interface:
!!   new_tallyMap1D -> builds an instance as a class(tallyMap1D)
!!   new_tallyMap   -> builds an instance as a class(tallyMap)
!!
!! NOTE:
!!   This factory is used by general tallyMap factory
